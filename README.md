# ConvosDeleter / SubsDivider
Parse a text to two for easier work in AegiSub (for those who set timestamps first and then put names and texts automatically, so "import" function doesn't help)

## To-Do List
### Done
- ~~Adding local storage usage for saving typed names (DONE)~~
- ~~Checking the lines that start with "–" (DONE)~~
- ~~Removing empty spaces if there's nothing after NAME: (DONE)~~
- ~~Joining lines starting with "–" if they're close to each other (DONE)~~
- ~~Control sums (number of lines for checking) (DONE)~~

### Functionality
- Try to drag location names to the 2nd position
- Delete empty strings from names

### Styling and appearance
- Color "\N" symbol like in AegiSub
- Brief instruction with examples
- Adding CSS
- Try to create positioned textareas

### Future plans
- Thinking of different methods of using this script
  - autodetecting names
  - two alternatives: either names and texts (the current one) or all together
